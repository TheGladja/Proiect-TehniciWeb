          This song changed the level of intensity with which we dreamed of reaching a certain point towards which the "Hands Of Angels" project is heading. We are more eager, enthusiastic, devoted and focused on what is to be HOA.

          Okay, the music exists, the characters that make it up also exist, but the most important factor makes the difference. This factor is the one that must be traveled to reach that point mentioned above. Do you know what this is about? About you!

          The public offers, to those who express themselves in any art form and not only (music in our case), what is more important besides the talent and work done by the person in question, namely support, trust, courage, which together means the power of to move on. If you want, people are that light at the end of a tunnel that never seems to end. It gives it color, warmth, it gives it life.

          Like "Don't kidnap me", there are other pieces created from lived moments, but with the aim that somewhere, someday, we can touch that light at the end of the tunnel and burn from the power of its flame.
