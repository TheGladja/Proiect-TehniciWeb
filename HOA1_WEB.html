          Music for All will be a catalyst to ensure that every child across America has access and opportunity to participate in active music-making in his or her scholastic environment.

          We will use our resources to provide national programs that recognize and support music students' performance and success, offer music educator training and professional development, and deliver tools and resources to participants and their communities that will assist them in supporting music education by promoting awareness of musicâ€™s impact on student growth and achievement.
